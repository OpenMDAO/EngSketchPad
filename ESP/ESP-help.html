    <p><h2 id="sec1">1.0: Overview</h2>

    <p>The Engineering Sketch Pad (ESP) is a browser-based program for
       creating, editing, and generating constructive solid models for
       use in the multi-disciplinary analysis and optimization of
       engineered systems.  <code>ESP</code> can use either the
       <code>EGADS/OpenCASCADE</code> or <code>CAPRI</code> geometric
       modeler.

    <p> In most cases, a user will start with a configuration that is
       described in a <code>.csm</code> file and then modify it and/or
       build it via <code>OpenCSM</code>'s various commands.

    <!---------------------------------------------------------------->

    <p><h2 id="sec2">2.0: Tutorial</h2>

    <p>This Tutorial will help you understand the use
       of <code>serveCSM</code> and ,code>ESP</code> for a variety of
       tasks.  Details about the Command Line, cursor and keyboard
       options, and the <code>.csm</code> file are contained in
       sections that follow this Tutorial.

    <p>The Tutorial starts with a pre-made part that is defined by the
       file <code>tutorial.csm</code>.  (See
       "Example <code>.csm</code> file" below for a listing of this
       file.)

    <p>To start <code>ESP</code> there are two steps: (1) start the
       "server" and (2) start the "browser".  This can be done in a
       variety of ways, but the two most common follow.

    <p><strong>Technique 1:</strong> issue the two commands:
      <pre>
        setenv WV_START "open -a /Applications/Firefox.app ../ESP/ESP.html"
        serveCSM ../data/tutorial
      </pre>
      if using a c-shell; make appropriate changes for your shell
      and/or operating system.

    <p>The first of these tells <code>serveCSM</code> to open FireFox
      on the file <code>../ESP/ESP.html</code>
      when <code>serveCSM</code> has generated a graphical
      representation of the configuration.  The second of these
      actually starts the <code>serveCSM</code> server.  As long as
      the browser stays connected
      to <code>serveCSM</code>, <code>serveCSM</code> will stay alive
      and handle requests sent to it from the browser.  Once the last
      browser that is connected to <code>serveCSM</code>
      exits, <code>serveCSM</code> will shut down.

    <p><strong>Technique 2:</strong> issue the command:
      <pre>
        serveCSM ../data/tutorial
      </pre>
      Once the server starts, start a browser (for example, FireFox or
      GoogleChrome) and open the page <code>ESP/ESP.html</code>.  As
      above, <code>serveCSM</code> will stay alive as long as there is
      a browser attached to it.

    <p>Note that the default "port" used by <code>serveCSM</code> is
      7681.  One can change the port in the call
      to <code>serveCSM</code> with a command such as:
      <pre>
        serveCSM ../data/tutorial -port 7788
      </pre>

    <p>Once the browser starts, you will be prompted for a
      "hostname:port" as in:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig01.png"/>

    <p>Most of the time, the "hostname" will be "Localhost" (meaning
      that <code>serveCSM</code> and the browser are on the same
      computer).  It is possible to attach to <code>serveCSM</code>
      that is running on another computer by giving an appropriate
      "hostname".

    <p>As mentioned above, it is possible to change the "port" with
      a command line argument when starting <code>serveCSM</code>; if
      that is done, then the alternative "port" must be included in
      <code>ESP</code>'s prompt.

    <p>Once all the setup is done, the browser then presents the
    following 3 windows:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig02.png"/>

    <p>The window on the top left is called the "Tree" window.  It
      contains listings of the Parameters and Branches in the model.
      It also contains the controls for the "Graphics" window.

    <p>The window on the top right is called the "Graphics" window.
      It contains a graphical representation of the current
      configuration.

    <p>The window on the bottom is called the "Messages" window.  It
      contains the messages that <code>ESP</code> posts for the user.

    <p>The first thing to do is to play with the image in the
      "Graphics" window.  This is done with the mouse in the following
      ways:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drag</strong>: translate the graphical image</li>
        <li><strong>Shift-Drag</strong>: moving mouse up while
          dragging zooms in while moving the mouse down while dragging
          zooms out</li>
        <li><strong>Ctrl-Drag</strong>: rotate the object about its
          center</li>
        <li><strong>Alt-Drag</strong>: rotate the view about an axis
          that is perpendicular to the screen</li>
      </ul>
      It is suggested that you use the left mouse button for these
      operations, since in most browsers the right mouse button will
      post a popup menu.

    <p>At any time, a user might want to "save" a view.  This is done
      by pressing the "&gt;" key; the "saved" view can be retrieved by
      pressing the "&lt;" key.  If you want to retrieve a view more
      than once, simply press "&gt;" after retrieving to re-"save" the
      view.  If you press "&lt;" twice, you will be returned to the
      original view.

    <p>Standard views can be obtained by pressing:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>x</strong>: view from the negative x direction
          (with y to the top and z to the right)</li>
        <li><strong>X</strong>: view from the positive x direction
          (with y to the right and z to the top)</li>
        <li><strong>y</strong>: view from the negative y direction
          (with z to the top and x to the right)</li>
        <li><strong>Y</strong>: view from the positive y direction
          (with z to the right and x to the top)</li>
        <li><strong>z</strong>: view from the negative z direction
          (with x to the right and y to the bottom)</li>
        <li><strong>Z</strong>: view from the positive z direction
          (with x to the right and y to the top)</li>
      </ul>

    <p>When using the mouse, it is possible to enter "flying mode", in
      which the view continually changes until the mouse button is
      released.  Flying mode is particularly useful when one needs to
      translate a long distance.  Toggling flying mode is done with
      the "!" key.

    <p>To interrogate the image, simply put your cursor over any
      object in the "Graphics" window and press "q"; a summary of the
      identified object is shown in the "Messages" window.

    <p>Lastly, to get help on the commands that are available in the
      "Graphics" window, press "?" and a short listing will be given
      in the "Messages" window.

    <p>The results of several of these commands is shown in:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig03.png"/>

    <p>Now it is time to understand the "Tree" window.  At the top of
      the "Tree" window is a series of buttons:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Up to date</strong>: the meaning and text on this
          button will change (as described below)</li>
        <li><strong>Help</strong>: this button opens up
          the <code>ESP</code> HELP document (that you are now
          reading)</li>
        <li><strong>Undo</strong>: allows a user to un-do any changes
          to the "model" (as described below)</li>
        <li><strong>Save</strong>: allows a user to save the current
        "model"</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Below the buttons is a tree-like representation of the
      "Parameters" and "Branches" that describe the current "model".
      In all cases, pressing the "+" at the beginning of any line
      expands (opens up) that particular entry in the tree; pressing
      the "-" at the beginning of any line collapses (closes) that
      particular entry.

    <p>Start off by pressing the "+" to the left of the word
      "Parameters".  When this is done, all the parameters in the
      current model are displayed as shown in:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig04.png"/>

    <p>Notice that some of the parameter names are shown in green
      type; this indicates that the parameter can be "editted" by the
      user; those listed in black type are "read-only" parameters that
      cannot be editted.

    <p>Press on the label "__Lbar" to edit the parameter named "Lbar".
      (The leading underscores are there to adjust spacing in the
      listings and are NOT part of the actual parameter name.)  When
      this is done, the user is provided with a prompt that asks for
      the new value; the current value is pre-loaded in this prompt
      window, as in:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig05.png"/>

    <p>For now change the value to "9" and press "OK".  Note that the
      parameter name is now listed in red (to indicate that it has
      been changed) and that the button at the top of the "Tree"
      window has changed to a green button that says "Press to
      re-build".  This tells the user that changes have been made, but
      that the configuration shown in the "Graphics" window has not
      been updated.  (The reason this is done is that a user might
      want to make several changes to the "model" before spending the
      CPU time necessary to re-build.)

    <p>Press the "Press to re-build" button and notice that it first
      turns yellow while the configuration is being rebuilt.  Then
      (after a few seconds) the image in the "Graphics" window will be
      updated and the "Parameters" will no longer be red.

    <p>We will now change the value of "Lbar" back.  But this time,
      instead of pressing on "__Lbar", we will use the
      context-sensitive menu.  To do this, right-click on the "__Lbar"
      and the following menu will be displayed:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig06.png"/>

    <p>The first item in this menu, "Edit", is the default action that
      happens when you clicked on "__Lbar" (previously).  Choose
      "Edit" and change the value back to "6". (Do not re-build yet.)

    <p>Collapse the parameters by pressing the "-" to the left of the
      word "Parameters" and expand the branches by pressing the "+" to
      the left of the word "Branches".  This will result in a screen
      that looks like:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig07.png"/>

    <p>There is an "Undo" button near the top of the "Tree" window.
      This button un-does your last change; an example of using this
      is shown later in this tutorial.  If you use this button, the
      banch names on you screen will differ from those seen here
      (since the branch names are generated sequentially).  Therefore,
      when the instructions below refer to "Brch_0000xx", translate
      that branch name into the branch name on your screen; the
      relative positions on the branches in your list should match
      those that ae shown in this tutorial.

    <p>We are going to want to add a "sphere" to this configuration.
      Do this by pressing "Branches", giving you the prompt:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig08.png"/>

    <p>We will choose a "sphere" and press "OK", giving us:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig09.png"/>

    <p>Now fill in the entries with "xcent" set to "1", "ycent" set to
      "0", "zcent" set to "0", and "radius" set to "2".  Press "OK"
      and then "Press to -rebuild" and you should see:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig10.png"/>

    <p>Now let's look at the "Display" part of the "Tree" window.  By
      default "Display" is expanded and you can see that you have two
      bodies named "Body 10" and "Body 9".  Expand the listing for
      Body 9 by pressing the "+" to the left of "Body 9" and you will
      see entries for faces and edges.  To the right of "____Faces"
      (below "__Body 9") you will see three items:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Viz</strong>: toggles the visibility of all faces
          associated with Body 9</li>
        <li><strong>Grd</strong>: toggles the grid associated with all
          the faces in Body 9</li>
        <li><strong>Trn</strong>: toggles the pseudo-transparency of
          all the faces associated with Body 9</li>
      </ul>
      Try each of these and see what happens.  (Notice that Body 9 is
      the original solid and Body 10 is the new sphere.)

    <p>Notice also that there is a "+" to the left of "____Faces",
      which indicates that you can interact with the object on a
      face-by-face basis.  The basic rules here are:
      <ul>
        <li>changes made to a specific entity (such as a face of edge)
          applies only to that entity</li>
        <li>changes made to the heading (such as "____Faces") applies
          to all faces in the group</li>
        <li>changes made at the Body level applies to all faces and
          edges in the body</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Now let's "combine" the sphere and the original solid by adding
      a "union" branch.  (Press "Branches" and add a "union").
      Re-build the configuration and you should get the solid shown
      in:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig11.png"/>

    <p>Note that we now only have one body.

    <p>After some thought you realize that you really didn't want the
      fusion of these two volumes, but instead you wanted the solid
      that is common to them.  First, remove the "union"; this can
      easily be done by right-clicking on "Branches" and then choosing
      "Delete last Branch".

    <p>Now add the intersection by pressing "Branches" and then
      choosing "intersect".  This operation wants to know what happens
      if more than one solid is produced by the operation.
      Specifically, the "$order" argument describes how the bodies
      that are produced should be ordered: for example in order of
      volume, surface area, ...  The "index" argument tells which body
      in the list should be selected.  Since we are only expecting one
      body to be produced, we can leave the defaults and then "Press
      to re-build", producing:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig12.png"/>

    <p>You notice that the "head" is too thin, and so you change the
      "radius" of the "sphere" to "2.3".  (Press "__Brch_000011" and
      change the "radius".)  While you are at it, change the parameter
      "__Rbar" to "0.4" (you will need to expand the parameters) and
      rebuild, producing:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig13.png"/>

    <p>Now we want to drill a hole through the center of the shaft;
      this is done by subtracting a cylinder from the solid; this is
      done with "Branches" and "cylinder".  We want to the hole to go
      the entire length of the configuration (which is centered and
      whose length is 2*L), and so we enter "-1.2*L" for "xbeg" and
      "+1.2*L" for "xend"; the "1.2" simply ensures that the cylinder
      extends beyond the end of the configuration.  Since it is on
      the centerline, set "ybeg", "zbeg", "ybeg", and "yend" all to
      "0", and finally the "radius" to "0.2".

    <p>Note that any argument can either be entered as a numeric
      constant or as an expression (using Matlab-like syntax),
      possibly using the name of a parameter (such as "L").

    <p>To add the "subtract" branch, we will right-click on "Branches"
      and choose "Add Branch at end" (which is the same as
      left-clicking on "Branches" since it is listed in the
      context-sensitive menu first).  Choose "subtract", use the
      defaults and rebuild, producing:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig14.png"/>

    <p>Now we want to create a series (pattern) of small holes that
      are drilled across the shaft.  Start by creating a new parameter
      (by clicking on "Parameters") and name it "Rhole".  The rules for
      names is that they must start with a letter and contain up to 32
      letters, digits, and underscores.  Since parameters can have
      multiple values (think "array"), <code>ESP</code> asks for the
      number of rows and columns.  Since we only have a single value,
      enter "1" for both of these and then the value "0.08".

    <p>Now we are going to add a pattern of holes.  Do this by adding
      a new "patbeg" branch; the "$pmtrName" will be "i" and the
      "ncopy" will be 7 (since we want 7 holes).  (The "$" at the
      beginning of "$pmtrName" says that this is the name of the
      parameter that will be created rather than the value of the
      parameter "i".  Also add a "cylinder" with "xbeg" and "xend" set
      to "i/3", "ybeg" and "yend" set to "0", "zbeg" set to "-1",
      "zend" set to "+1", and "radius" set to "Rhole".  Press "OK".

    <p>We would now like to name this branch.  To do this, edit the
      branch (by pressing "__Brch_000017") and change its "Name" to
      "small_holes".  (Notice that we could not name it when we
      created it since the names are originally auto-created to ensure
      that we do not get an illegal name.)

    <p>Next add another "subtract" branch and finally a "patend"
      branch and then re-build (which will take several seconds),
      giving:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig15.png"/>

    <p>Now we want to change the hole in the center of the shaft into
      a hole that starts at "xbeg" equal to "0".  Make the change to
      "__Brch_000014" and re-build.  To see if you were successful,
      change the visibility of the faces and ensure that you have the
      correct hole, as in:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig16.png"/>

    <p>Now change the cylindrical hole into a conical hole.  To do
      this, we must delete the cylinder hole (which is Brch_000014).
      Right-click on "__Brch_000014" and choose "Delete this Branch".
      Notice that doing this tells you that you have an error.  To fix
      the error, add a conical hole after "__Brch_000013" by
      right-clicking "__Brch_000013" and choosing "Add Branch after",
      as in:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig17.png"/>

    <p>Re-build and notice that the vertex of the cone is near the
      head; we had meant to do it the other way, so change "xvrtx"
      to "0" and "xbase" to "1.2*L" and re-build, producing (after
      manipulating the display):
    <p><img src="ESP-fig18.png"/>

    <p>Now let's rotate the small holes, so after the
      "__small_holes" branch, add a "rotatex" with arguments
      "-15*(i-1)", "0", and "0", and rebuild, producing:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig19.png"/>

    <p>Now we will experiment with the "activity" of the branches.  A
      branch that is "suppressed" is skipped during the re-build
      process. So press on "__small_holes" and set the activity to
      "Suppressed".  Note that a few other branches become "inactive"
      (since they cannot be executed).  Re-build, producing:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig20.png"/>

    <p>Now suppress "__Brch_000021" and activate "__small_holes" and
      re-build.  Note that the hole re-appeared but that the rotatex
      is not executed.  Finally, re-activate all branches and
      re-build.

    <p>Another feature is <code>ESP</code> allows a user to only build
      part of the configuration.  This is done by right-clicking on a
      branch (for example, "__Brch_000010") and choosing "Build to
      this Branch", giving:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig21.png"/>

    <p>To rebuild the whole configuration, re-build to the last
      branch.

    <p>The last part of the <code>ESP</code> tutorial involves
      attributes.  Each branch can have zero or more attributes
      associated with it that are carried throughout the build
      process.  By pressing the "+" to the left of "__Brch_000009",
      its attribute ("____clipper") can be seen to have the value "1".
      Change the attribute to "10" by pressing "____clipper" and
      entering "10" at the prompt.

    <p>We can add an attribute to "__Brch_000009" by right-clicking
      and choosing "Add Attribute"; use the name "test" and the value
      "ESP".  Press the "+" to the left of "__Brch_000009" and you
      will see that the branch now has 2 attributes.  After some
      thought, you realize that "ESP" is not defined, so you can
      "undo" this change by pressing the "Undo" button at the top of
      the "Tree" window.  Re-build.

    <p>Now point to the face the represents the corner of the head (as
      shown with its grid here) and press the "q" key, producing:
    <p><img src="ESP-fig22.png"/>

    <p>Note that the "Messages" window contains a description of the
      face including the attribute that we editted ("clipper" is "10")
      as well as a "body" and "brch" attribute.  The latter tells
      which branch ("__Brch_000009") was responsible for generating
      that face.

    <p>Lastly, save your work by pressing the "Save" button and
      choosing "tutorial_new.csm" as the name of the new file.  Exit
      the browser and you should see that <code>serveCSM</code> also
      shuts down.

    <p>If we now rename the file journal file with:
      <pre>
        mv port7681.jrnl tutorial.jrnl
      </pre>
      we can replay our session by the command:
      <pre>
        serveCSM ../data/tutorial -jrnl tutorial.jrnl
      </pre>

    <p>Alternatively, we can start with the new
      <code>tutorial_new.csm</code> file with the command:
      <pre>

      </pre>

    <p>This tutorial covered most of <code>ESP</code>'s user
      interface.  Further details are contained in the sections that
      follow.

    <p><h2 id="sec3">3.0: Command Line</h2>

    <p>To start <code>serveCSM</code>, one uses the command:
      <pre>
        serveCSM filename [-port portnum] [-outLevel n] [-jrnl jrnlname]
      </pre>

    <p>The <code>-port</code> option tells <code>serveCSM</code> with which
      port to connect.

    <p>The <code>-outLevel</code> option sets the level of output (0
      to 3) that the server should produce during its execution.
      Higher numbers are useful for debugging and should seldom be used
      by most users.

    <p>The <code>-jrnl</code> option is useful for replaying a
      previous session.  This journal file is an ASCII file that can
      be created with any text-editor.  But more typically, user
      modifies the file <code>portX.jrnl</code> that is automatically
      produced every time <code>serveCSM</code> is started.  (Note: be
      sure to copy and/or rename this file before using it as an input
      to <code>serveCSM</code> since the next <code>serveCSM</code>
      will overwrite this file.

    <p><h2 id="sec4">4.0: Interactive Options</h2>

    <p>The Tutorial (above) gives an overview of nearly all the
       interactive commands that are available in <code>ESP</code>.
       Future versions of this document will add more details here.

    <p><a href="#sec0">Table of Contents</a>

    <!---------------------------------------------------------------->

    <p><h2 id="sec5">5.0: Format of the <code>.csm</code> File</h2>

    <p>The <code>.csm</code> file contains a series of statements.

    <p>If a line contains a hash (#), all characters starting at the
       hash are ignored.

    <p>If a line contains a backslash, all characters starting at the
       backslash are ignored and the next line is appended; spaces at
       the beginning of the next line are treated normally.

    <p>All statements begin with a keyword (described below) and must
       contain at least the indicated number of arguments.

    <p>Extra arguments in a statement are discarded and can thus be
       used as a comment.

    <p>The last statement must be "end". (Everything else is ignored.)

    <p>All arguments must not contain any spaces or must be enclosed
       in a pair of double quotes (for example, "a + b").

    <p>Parameters are evaluated in the order that they appear in the
       file, using MATLAB-like syntax (see "Expression rules" below).

    <p>During the build process, <code>OpenCSM</code> maintains a LIFO
       "Stack" that can contain Bodies and Sketches.

    <p>The csm statements are executed in a stack-like way, taking
       their inputs from the Stack and depositing their results onto
       the Stack.

    <p>The default name for each Branch is "Brch_xxxxxx", where xxxxxx
       is a unique sequence number.

    <p><h3>5.1: Special characters</h3>
      <pre>
        #          introduces comment
        "          ignore spaces until following "
        \          ignore this and following characters and concatenate next line

        ,          separates function arguments and row/column in subscripts
        ;          multi-value item separator
        ( )        groups expressions and function arguments
        [ ]        specifies subscripts in form [row,column]
        + - * / ^  arithmetic operators
        !          as first character, forces argument to be evaluated
        $          as first character, forces argument not to be evaluated (used internally)
        @          as first character, introduces named constants

        ~          not used
        %          not used

    <p>All reports of possible "bugs" and any other feedback should be
       e-mailed to "jfdannen@syr.edu".  If a bug report, please
       include the version number you are running (listed in the title
       bar at the top of the program), what you were doing at the time
       of the bug, and what happened that you didn't expect.  The more
       information that you include, the better the chances that the
       bug can be reproduced and hence fixed.
